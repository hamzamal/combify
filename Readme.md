How will you host the API in the cloud?
I will host the API in cloud using Azure App Service. Azure App Service provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. Azure cloud shell can be used for deployment. First step is to create App Service resources using Azure CLI and then we can deploy the API to Azure using Git.
App Service has built-in support for user authentication and authorization.
How will you update the model continuously as more data becomes available?
I will use Auto-keras model to update the model continously as more data becomes available. it automatically trains a model on the data without having to tune the parameters. Array will be defined for training times and the model will be looped over this paprameter.
